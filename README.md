# GALLERY PROJECT

## FULLSTACK PRACTICE PROJECT NO: 16

1. A fullstack version of my previous frontend project to practice my skills using Javascript, Jquery, NodeJS, ExpressJS, HTML, CSS.

2. There are several games seperated as PS and PC games.

3. There is a small animation on mouse enter to zoom in.

4. When we click on the game it opens a new dynamic url for that game and brings the information of that game.
